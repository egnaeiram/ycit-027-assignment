// Write a function that mocks fetching a user from a database, but fails 50% of the time
// The whole operation can take a random amount of time between 0 and 1 seconds
// The function should return a promise that is fulfilled with the user object if the operation is successful
// You are not required to mock the arguments to the function, nor the database. Just return a predefined user object, such as: { id: 1, name: "John Doe" }
