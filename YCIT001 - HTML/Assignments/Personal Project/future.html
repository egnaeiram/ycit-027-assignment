<h1>UPCOMING PROJECTS</h1>
    <br>
    <p><h2>MULTISENSES POETRY BOOK</h2></p>
    <p>Sensorily pleasing expanding the reading to an hearing. I am a fan poetry but as much I love reading, my head goes everywhere. The idea for this project is creating a visual support while the poems are read. This whole piece would be accompanied of a unique composition made and chose for each of the piece. Rediscovering poetry by transmetting it into another form. Creating an album, a visual album of poetry.</p>
    <br>
    <p><h2>LEKI CHAINS GROWTH</h2></p>
    <p>A continuation of the exploration of the hands as model to develop new ways of wearing handchains as well as the interest into less commonly used parts of the body for jewellery.</p>
    <br>
    <p><h2>COLLECTIVE PLATFORM</h2></p>
    <p>Building a website regrouping friends, artists.
        The idea is to create a commun space to expand and learn from each other. A main page that is a shared vision and individual pages representing each self as an entity regrouping their work. The platform will also have a youtube channel connected to it with live music from musicians, djs around the globe.  
    </p>
    <p><h2>EP</h2></p>
    <p>Influenced by my love of reggaeton and techno, I am exploring the correlation both of their rythmytic genres shares.</p>
    <br>
    <p><h2>Fashion through my lense</h2></p>
    <p>A photo book. Building it through the years to have the creamiest and the most extravagant.</p>
